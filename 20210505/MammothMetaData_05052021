Mammoth Mountain Sampling
05/05/2021
Field Notes Description
Weather was calm and sunny with few-to-scattered cumulus clouds developing in early afternoon
Snow was frozen early, but began to soften up around 8:30am.
Normal scanning strategy was to do a reference scan, followed by a target scan.

Note that the data was erased between each scanning period, so at the start of each Scanning period, the file is 000
File naming convention is Rxxx_Txxx with "xxx" corresponding to the 3 digit number associated with a reference/target scanning pair.
Data is organized:
Wavelength, Reference dN, Target dN, Reflectance (%)

Three Scanning Periods were performed with data stored in corresponding subfolders:
1. Morning: Mammoth05052021_Morning
2. Midday - Large Foreoptic: Mammoth_Mountain_05052021_Afternoon
3. Midday - Gun Foreoptic: Mammoth_Mountain_05052021_Transmissivity

Transmissivity variable is a yes/no flag (1/0) indicating that this scan was upward looking through the snow
"ref" in the description column indicates a reference scan.

Morning: Density of top-layer snow was 423 kg/m3
Midday/Afternoon Sampling: Density of top-layer snow was 444

Visible Grainsize through "Hole" for the Transmissivity measurements was approximately 2-3mm, and the poresize was approximately 3-4mm.
